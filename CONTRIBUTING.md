## PyProBE structure
Additions to the code should be made in accordance with the structure of PyProBE, to 
maximise compatibility and ensure it is a maintainable package. Guidance for writing
code for PyProBE includes:
1. DataFrame operations should only be done using polars expressions. Data should be kept by default in polars LazyFrame format and only converted to DataFrame if needed for a particular operation.
2. Analysis classes should be written in the format described in the [documentation](
    https://congenial-adventure-mz797n5.pages.github.io/contributing_to_the_analysis_module.html
).

## Viewing the API documentation

API documentation is built in html format, and stored locally in docs/build/html/. This can be viewed in your browser at docs/build/html/index.html.

The documentation is also continuously deployed via GitHub Actions, and can be viewed [here](https://congenial-adventure-mz797n5.pages.github.io).
